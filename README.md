## ✨ Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

Our primary competitive advantage over generic public forums is **Trust and Accountability**.

| **Gla-Validated Content** | Community-sourced content only goes live after faculty/admin approval, ensuring 100% relevance to campus drives. |
| **The Moderation Loop** | A strict "Quality Gate" workflow that prevents misinformation from reaching the student dashboard. |
| **Systematic Tracking** | Visual Dashboards using dynamic Progress Rings for real-time Quiz Mastery and Video completion. |
| **Dynamic CMS Architecture** | Admins can scale the curriculum (e.g., adding 'Machine Learning') instantly without touching the codebase. |

## 🔒 Key Workflows & Features

### 1. The Quality Gate (Moderation Loop)
This central workflow ensures that students only study reliable material:

2. **Verification Queue:** Content remains in a "Pending" state, hidden from the public.
3. **Moderator Audit:** Admins review accuracy and relevance on the Control Center.
4. **Live Deployment:** Approved items instantly transition to "Verified" status.
